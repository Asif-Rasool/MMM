    st.markdown("""
To begin our recommendation system, we estimate a linear regression model where the dependent variable is the total revenue collected (`Amount_Collected`) by a business in a given period. The model aims to explain how marketing investments across various channels contribute to actual sales outcomes.

The estimated model is as follows:

    Amount_Collected = Œ≤‚ÇÄ + Œ≤‚ÇÅ(Campaign_Email) + Œ≤‚ÇÇ(Campaign_Flyer) + Œ≤‚ÇÉ(Campaign_Phone)
                     + Œ≤‚ÇÑ(Facebook) + Œ≤‚ÇÖ(Instagram) + Œ≤‚ÇÜ(YouTube) + Œ≤‚Çá(TikTok) + Œ≤‚Çà(LinkedIn)
                     + Œ≤‚Çâ(Campaign_Email √ó Campaign_Flyer) + ...
                     + Œ≤‚Çñ(LinkedIn √ó TikTok) + Œµ

In this specification:
- `Campaign_Email`, `Campaign_Flyer`, and `Campaign_Phone` represent direct spending on email, flyer, and phone-based campaigns.
- `Facebook`, `Instagram`, `YouTube`, `TikTok`, and `LinkedIn` represent platform-specific marketing exposure or spending.
- The interaction terms (e.g., `Campaign_Email √ó Instagram`, `YouTube √ó TikTok`) capture the joint effect of using two channels simultaneously. These terms help assess whether certain combinations of platforms or campaign types reinforce or dampen each other's impact.
- Œµ is the error term capturing unobserved factors.

This model includes all pairwise interaction terms between campaign and platform variables. After estimating the model on the full dataset, we identified variables that are statistically significant at the 5% level. These variables are retained in the filtered summary and serve as the key drivers of revenue.
The model's coefficients (Œ≤) indicate the expected change in `Amount_Collected` for a one-unit increase in each independent variable, holding all other variables constant. For example, if Œ≤‚ÇÅ = 0.5 for `Campaign_Email`, it suggests that increasing email spending by \$1 is associated with an increase in revenue of $0.50, assuming all other factors remain unchanged.
The model's R-squared value indicates the proportion of variance in `Amount_Collected` explained by the independent variables. A higher R-squared suggests a better fit, but it is essential to consider overfitting, especially with many interaction terms.

    st.markdown("""
While the overall model provides useful insights into average campaign effectiveness, it assumes that all businesses respond similarly to marketing inputs. To test this assumption, we estimated separate linear regression models for each `Client_Type`.

Each model uses the same structure as before, including all campaign variables, platform variables, and their pairwise interaction terms. By isolating the analysis within each business segment, we are able to identify which strategies work best for different types of firms‚Äîsuch as Large, Medium, Private, or Small Facilities.

This segmented approach helps answer one of our core questions: whether marketing strategies need to be tailored based on business type. The results tells us which variables are significant drivers of revenue for each segment, and how the effectiveness of various campaigns and platform combinations may vary across firm types.

The model explains about **44.6%** of the variation in total revenue, as indicated by the **R-squared** value of **0.446**. This means that nearly half of the differences we see in revenue across businesses can be linked to variations in their marketing strategies and platform usage. The **Adjusted R-squared**, which accounts for the number of variables included, is slightly lower at **0.433**, suggesting a strong explanatory power even after correcting for model complexity.

The model‚Äôs **F-statistic is 33.73**, and the associated probability is virtually zero (**p < 0.0001**), confirming that the overall model is statistically significant ‚Äî in other words, the marketing variables jointly help explain changes in revenue.

The model-level indicators such as the **Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)** and **Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)** ‚Äî recorded as **57,250** and **57,450**, respectively ‚Äî provide reference points for comparing with alternative model specifications. Lower values of AIC and BIC generally indicate a better model fit when comparing across models.

So, it is safe to conclude that the model is statistically significant and reasonably effective at capturing how marketing inputs relate to business performance.

While the pooled model gives us a general understanding of which marketing channels are effective, it assumes that all businesses respond similarly. 
To test this assumption, we ran separate linear regression models for each business type (e.g., Small Facility, Private Facility, Medium Facility, Large Facility).

Each model uses the same structure as the pooled model: it includes individual marketing variables, social media platforms, and interaction terms. 
By running the regression separately for each business category, we can capture segment-specific behaviors that would otherwise be averaged out in the pooled model.

The table and chart below summarize the **statistically significant predictors (p < 0.05)** within each business segment. 
This helps us identify **what works for whom** ‚Äî which marketing strategies are most effective depending on the business type.

For example:
- Some smaller businesses may benefit more from flyers or Facebook, while larger facilities may see stronger returns from TikTok or cross-platform campaigns.
- The direction and strength of these relationships vary, reinforcing that a one-size-fits-all marketing plan may not be optimal.

Segment-specific results give us a more nuanced view of the effectiveness of marketing strategies across business types, and will serve as a foundation for future targeted recommendations.

This section summarizes the key variables from the Medium Facility model that are statistically significant at the **5% level**. These predictors had a measurable and reliable impact on the amount of revenue collected, helping us understand which marketing strategies worked best for this business segment.

The **regression coefficient** represents the expected change in `Amount_Collected` (in dollars) for a one-unit increase in that variable, holding all others constant. For example, a coefficient of 11.50 on `Facebook` means that each additional dollar of investment in Facebook marketing is associated with an average **$11.50 increase in revenue** for medium-sized businesses.

Large negative coefficients can also emerge‚Äîfor instance, if a strategy not only fails to help but may actively harm revenue. Such is the case with `Campaign_Phone`, whose coefficient of **-2,479** (clipped in the chart) indicates a strongly adverse effect, possibly due to overuse or client aversion to phone-based campaigns.

Interaction terms (e.g., `Campaign_Phone √ó Facebook`) reveal how combined marketing efforts behave differently than individual ones. A positive interaction implies synergy, while a negative one suggests overlap, redundancy, or even conflict between strategies.
