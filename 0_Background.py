The Northshore region has seen steady growth in its small business sector over the past decade. But for many of these businesses, finding and reaching the right audience remains a challenge. Marketing budgets are limited, digital ad platforms are complex, and most owners donâ€™t have time to experiment or optimize.

At the same time, the way consumers make decisions has changed. Social media now plays a central role in how people discover, evaluate, and choose businessesâ€”across sectors like retail, dining, health, and services. Despite this, many local campaigns underperform or fail to connect with the right audience.

This project introduces a model designed to help Northshore businesses run smarter, more effective ad campaignsâ€”primarily through social media, but also other channels where appropriate. It evaluates whatâ€™s working, whatâ€™s not, and provides a strategy to maximize return on investment.

There are two core objectives of this project  
1. **To measure the impact of each marketing and social media campaign on actual sales** â€” measured through the dollar amount collected.  
2. **To determine whether the same strategy works across different types of businesses**, or whether tailored approaches are needed depending on industry, size, or customer base.

Developed by Dr. Asif Rasool, Research Economist at the **Business Research Center** in the **College of Business at Southeastern Louisiana University**, this model blends local economic data with ad performance insights to guide better marketing decisions. It offers a targeted, data-informed approach rather than a one-size-fits-all solution.

At its core, this work supports economic development. Helping small businesses reach more customers means stronger revenues, job creation, and a more resilient local economy. For a growing region like Northshore, that kind of support can make a measurable difference.
