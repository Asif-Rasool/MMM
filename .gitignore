I want to deploy my streamlit based web app on google cloud. In addition to the files I have attached here, some info: 

Github repo: Asif-Rasool/MMM: A data-driven tool to help Northshore businesses run smarter marketing campaigns. Combines synthetic data, model insights, and Streamlit-based UI to explore ROI by client type, platform, and competition.

My secret and config files are saved in: .streamlit\config.toml, and .streamlit\secrets.toml
My google cloud has billing account setup working as I have deployed several apps there and they are working.
My app has a builtin chatbot that uses vertex ai, the secrets are in the secrets.toml
I am used anaconda prompt to communicate with gcloud In addition deploy my app GCP, i want to create a Cloud Trigger as well, so that whenever I commit my work to github, my app automatically get the updates.
Your task is to guide me, that includes generating codes, updating my config files etc. Let me know if you need any additional info to help me better.

I'll help you deploy your Streamlit app on Google Cloud Platform and set up automatic deployment with Cloud Build triggers. Based on your files, I can see you already have a good foundation with your cloudbuild.yaml.

Let me guide you through the complete process:

1. First, let's update your Cloud Build configuration

Updated cloudbuild.yaml
Code 
2. Create a Dockerfile for better control

Dockerfile
Code 
3. Create .dockerignore file

.dockerignore
Code 
4. Commands to execute in your Anaconda Prompt
Here are the step-by-step commands you need to run:


Deployment Commands
Code 
5. Connect your GitHub repository
You'll need to connect your GitHub repository to Google Cloud Build. Here's how:


GitHub Repository Connection
Code 
6. Sample Streamlit configuration files
Here are templates for your Streamlit config files:


.streamlit/config.toml
Code 

.streamlit/secrets.toml (Template)
Code 
7. Updated Cloud Build with Dockerfile approach

Updated cloudbuild.yaml
Code ∙ Version 2 
Key Points to Remember:
Secrets Management: Your sensitive configuration is stored in Google Secret Manager, not in your repository.
Automatic Deployment: Once the trigger is set up, any push to your main branch will automatically deploy your app.
Service Account Permissions: The Cloud Build service account needs proper permissions to deploy to Cloud Run and access secrets.
Port Configuration: Streamlit runs on port 8501, which is configured in both the Dockerfile and Cloud Run deployment.
Troubleshooting Commands:

Troubleshooting Commands
Code 
Next Steps:
Update your repository with the new Dockerfile, updated cloudbuild.yaml, and .dockerignore files.
Run the deployment commands in your Anaconda Prompt in the order provided.
Test your deployment by making a small change to your repository and pushing to the main branch.
Monitor the build process in the Google Cloud Console under Cloud Build > History.
Would you like me to explain any specific part in more detail or help you with any issues you encounter during the deployment process?

here are my secret and config files

Perfect! Now I can see your actual configuration files. I notice you have API keys for various services and Google Cloud credentials. Let me update the deployment process with your specific configuration.

1. Updated Commands for Your Specific Setup

Deployment Commands
Code ∙ Version 2 
2. Updated Streamlit Config (using your theme)

.streamlit/config.toml
Code ∙ Version 2 
3. Security Recommendation
IMPORTANT: I noticed your secrets file contains actual API keys and a service account private key. For security, you should:

Remove the secrets.toml file from your GitHub repository immediately if it's currently there
Add .streamlit/secrets.toml to your .gitignore file

.gitignore additions
Code 
4. Complete Deployment Process
Run these commands in your Anaconda Prompt:


Complete Deployment Script
Code 
5. Updated Dockerfile for your dependencies

Dockerfile
Code ∙ Version 2 
6. Security Steps (CRITICAL)
Before deploying, please do the following:


Security Steps (CRITICAL)
Code 
7. Files to add to your repository
Make sure these files are in your repository:

Dockerfile (from artifact above)
Updated cloudbuild.yaml (from artifact above)
.dockerignore (from artifact above)
Updated .gitignore (from security steps above)
config.toml (keep this - it doesn't contain secrets)
DO NOT add secrets.toml to your repository!

8. Step-by-step execution order:
First: Run the security steps to protect your secrets
Second: Add the new files (Dockerfile, etc.) to your repo and push
Third: Run the deployment commands
Fourth: Test the deployment
Fifth: Set up the GitHub trigger
9. Testing your deployment
After deployment, your app should be available at:

https://mmm-app-[hash]-uc.a.run.app
You can find the exact URL by running:

bash
gcloud run services describe mmm-app --region=us-central1 --format="value(status.url)"
Would you like me to help you with any specific part of this process, or do you have questions about the security steps?

check the following files:

I can see your files and there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

Issues Found:
Your cloudbuild.yaml is using the old version (source deployment instead of Docker)
Your Dockerfile needs updates for better compatibility with your dependencies
Your .gitignore has duplicated entries that should be cleaned up
Let me provide the corrected versions:

1. Updated cloudbuild.yaml (Use Docker approach)

Updated cloudbuild.yaml
Code 
2. Updated Dockerfile (with proper dependencies for your packages)

Dockerfile
Code 
3. Clean .gitignore file

Clean .gitignore
Code 
4. Updated Deployment Commands

Complete Deployment Script
Code 
Action Items:
Replace your current cloudbuild.yaml with the updated Docker version above
Replace your current Dockerfile with the updated version that has better dependency handling
Replace your .gitignore with the cleaned version to remove duplicates
Commit and push these changes to your repository
Run the deployment commands in the order provided
Key Changes Made:
cloudbuild.yaml: Now uses Docker build approach instead of source deploymen
